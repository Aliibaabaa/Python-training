# create a program with predefined data. 
# Upon entering a username, the program checks if the username already exists. 
#   If the username is found and belongs to an admin, it displays "You are an admin" and offers the option to register a new user by providing a username and age. 
#       If you choose not to register a new user, the program displays a list of all users. 
# 
# If the username exists but is not an admin, it welcomes the user and informs them that they are not an admin.
# 
# If the entered username is not found, the program displays "Invalid username" and 
# offers the option to register a new user by providing a username and age. 
# 
# For admin users, there is an additional option to set the new accounts as admin or not. 
# If you are not an admin, the program will simply list all the users, including yourself.
